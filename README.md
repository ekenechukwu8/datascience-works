# K-Means Clustering & PCA on Boston Housing Dataset

This project was completed as part of my coursework for CS 4267 - Machine Learning. It demonstrates the implementation of **K-Means Clustering from scratch** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** using the classic Boston Housing dataset.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Implemented K-Means clustering **without using `sklearn.cluster`**
- Created 4 clusters on the Boston housing data (excluding the categorical 'RAD' column)
- Visualized clusters using:
  - **t-SNE** (non-linear dimensionality reduction)
  - **PCA** (2D and 3D scatter plots)

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn (only for PCA and t-SNE)
- Google Colab

## 📁 Files

- `ekene_azubuike_assignment2_boston_kmeans.ipynb`: Full notebook with code, comments, and visualizations

## 📈 Results

- Observed meaningful clustering of housing data based on normalized features
- Compared 2D and 3D PCA projections for better visualization of cluster separation

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Algorithm implementation from scratch
- Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE)
- Data visualization and interpretation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Run all cells to load data, perform clustering, and visualize results
3. No installation required—runs entirely in Colab
